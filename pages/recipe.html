    <h3>Decription</h3>
    <p>
      Yogurt is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk. The bacteria used to make yogurt are known as yogurt cultures. 
      Fermentation of sugars in the milk by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor. 
      Cow's milk is the milk most commonly used to make yogurt, although the milk of other animals can be used. 
      The milk used may be homogenized or not. It may be pasteurized or raw. Each type of milk produces substantially different results.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yogurt is produced using a culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus bacteria. 
      In addition, other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are sometimes added during or after culturing yogurt.
